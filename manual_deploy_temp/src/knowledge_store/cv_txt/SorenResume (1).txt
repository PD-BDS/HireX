SØREN
Consultant


Summary
======
As a freelance mechanical engineer with a strong foundation in both R&D and consultancy, I specialize in developing customized mechanical solutions across various industries, including wind energy, construction, and product development. Over the past year, I have been engaged as a consultant, most recently serving as Technical Manager on a project for GE, where I was responsible for implementing design modifications on conveyor systems used in wind turbine blade production. I have also contributed as a Design Engineer at MinAltan, preparing comprehensive 3D and 2D documentation for structural components such as stairs, balconies, and landings. Prior to transitioning into consultancy, I led the design work for the DecomBlades R&D project. My responsibilities included the complete development cycle—from reactor design and prototype fabrication to testing and commissioning a full-scale experimental facility. This role strengthened my expertise in high-temperature systems, airtight construction, and process development. Driven by a creative mindset and a solid technical background, I excel in dynamic, innovation-driven environments. I adopt a hands-on approach and have a proven ability to take ideas from concept to implementation efficiently and effectively.
