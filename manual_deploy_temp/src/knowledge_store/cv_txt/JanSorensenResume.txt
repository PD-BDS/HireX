JAN SØRENSEN


Summary
======
In the Danish construction industry, I was responsible for ensuring that goods and equipment delivered to the site aligned with the purchase order and met quality standards. In cases of damaged goods, I reported the issue to management to ensure prompt resolution. 
In the cement industry, I developed a replicable O&M concept integrating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with HSE management systems. As a quarry manager in Angola, I crafted HSE protocols for the quarry and crusher area and contributed to site wide HSE initiatives. My focus has been on improving raw material quality, reducing fuel use, and lowering emissions.
At Logical Safety, I gained expertise in digital HSE systems, LOTO systems, and sensor-based safety.
In Cairo, I lectured on operational safety and developed an HSE Workplace Evaluation for a Danish factory in 2022.
