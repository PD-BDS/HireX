Validation, Quality Compliance


Summary
======
I have been dedicated to ensuring quality, compliance, and operational excellence within highly regulated industries, including the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors. I bring extensive experience in IT compliance, information security, and regulatory governance, with a strong foundation in ISO 27001 and ISO 27002, GxP requirements, and GAMP5. I have implemented and maintained Quality Management Systems aligned with ISO 9001, and supported organizations in achieving and sustaining compliance through internal and external audits, risk assessments, and policy development. My work has spanned Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), IT risk management, and validation of computerized systems and production equipment, including FAT, SAT, IQ, OQ, and PQ activities. I have a structured and pragmatic approach to aligning business processes with regulatory requirements and have successfully led compliance initiatives across cross-functional teams. I am skilled in training and guiding staff to ensure awareness and adherence to standards, and I have a proven ability to analyze complex data to inform leadership decisions and enhance compliance reporting
