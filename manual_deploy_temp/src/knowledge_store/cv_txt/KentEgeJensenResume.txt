Summary
======
Working and carrying out jobs in approx. 60 countries worldwide I graduated in January 1993, and after a short period working for the Danish Government, I started working for FLSmidth in Denmark as Process/Operation Commissioning and Chief Commissioning Engineer. I travelled all over the world starting up cement plant equipment. In May 1998 I took up a position in FLSmidth Process Design, where my main areas of work were pyro line upgrades, the complete pyro process design, firing technology and its design and emission control/in field measurements. During this period of approx. 5.5 years I was still doing quite a lot of infield jobs worldwide trouble shooting, establish basis for upgrade projects, consultancy, emission measurements and running performance tests etc. In 2003 (autumn) I decided to move to Bangkok, Thailand where I am living at present. I took up an equal work position in L.V. Technology Public Company Limited as process design and sales engineer. I have later been the Manager of the LVT Process Design Department for some years but was (since 2010 and until I stopped working for LVT at 2015 end) holding the title as Senior Technical Advisor in LVT Process. Within the last 5 years my main area of work with LVT was in field jobs worldwide
