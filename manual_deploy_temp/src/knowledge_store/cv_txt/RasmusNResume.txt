RASMUS N


Summary
======
Experienced Marine engineer. (46 years old) 12 years offshore/onshore in the management team. In that way, I got a proven track record in succeeding with leading others, strategy work, budgeting, and management in general. I have worked with planning and projects development for approximately 5 years. Besides, I got massive operational experience from both maintenance and production as supervisors. All that on top of 8 years' hands-on experience as electricians and service engineer at the beginning of my career. My technical skills, leadership skills and understanding of engineering combined with drive and motivation have often resulted in high-level problem-solving both as individual but also as supervisor when coaching the team.
