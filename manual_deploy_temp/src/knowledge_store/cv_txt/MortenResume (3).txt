Summary
======
Experienced in both offshore and onshore oilfields, I have led production supervision and operations. As Operations Team Lead in Qatar, I managed production, maintenance, and campaign planning while acting as HSE Site Authority. I oversaw shutdowns, the Control of Work system, and staff coaching. My Mechanical Engineering background enhances my ability to optimize production safely and efficiently. Recently, I worked onshore as a Pressure Vessel Inspection Engineer for Semco Maritime (Total Energies), managing offshore inspection programs, planning, cost control, and coordinating repairs to ensure technical quality and safety.
