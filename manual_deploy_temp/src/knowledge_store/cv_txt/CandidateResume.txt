Summary

I am an experienced lead engineer with more than 25 years of experience working as Site, Commissioning, and Process manager. I have strong communicative and interpersonal skills together with profound experience working across cultures and across professional disciplines. I am a team player with focus on planning, executing, problem solving during pre-planning, erection, and commissioning. I am used to that training and education of the on-site personnel is an integrated part of handing over the project. I am experienced in project execution at all stages ranging from proposals and process design to start-up and performance testing of process plants. Including calculation of process flow diagrams, design of piping and instrument diagrams, and specification of equipment
