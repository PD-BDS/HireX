Summary
======
Graduating as a marine engineer in 2023, and with a background as a mechanic, my primary interests lie in technical and hands-on tasks at my future workplace. I bring a good sense of humor, along with a positive and open mindset, ready to embrace new and valuable learning experiences. Collaboration comes naturally to me at all levels of an organization, as well as with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, which I have gained through previous jobs and extended travels abroad.
