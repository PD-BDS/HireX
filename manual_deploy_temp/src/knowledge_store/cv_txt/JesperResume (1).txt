NPI Project Manager


Summary
======
Project manager with expertise in interdisciplinary coordination and progress As an experienced project manager with a technical background as engineer, I have specialized in running projects from Idea phase for full implementation in complex production environments. I thrive on taking a central role as a link between production, suppliers and other departments to ensure that resources, quality and deadlines are always optimally coordinated. I am structured, analytical and result-oriented, with a documented ability to maintain an overview, even when there are many balls in the air. My leadership includes planning, managing and following up on projects, just as I actively contribute to continuous optimization of processes to ensure efficiency and progress. I am motivated by creating tangible results and have a natural ability to motivate and create momentum in teams. I am used to working in growth companies, where my technical well-grounding and my creative solutions to complex problems have been crucial to success.
