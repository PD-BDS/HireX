JACOB


Summary
======
I am a marine engineer, educated at FMS Fredericia in January 2024, with a background as an electrician. I am technically inclined and motivated by new tasks and challenges that help raise my technical or leadership level. I maintain a good overview and stay calm under pressure. No task is too big or too small—every task is important and must be completed. I am motivated by teamwork and thrive best in environments that foster dialogue and collaboration. With me, you get an energetic and motivated colleague who is passionate about expanding his skills across a broad range of areas, whether it's testing systems, service and commissioning, operations, R&D, and more.
