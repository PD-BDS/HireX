HENRIK E RASMUSSEN
Mechanical Engineer


Summary
======

Collaborative by nature, I thrive in team environments where knowledge-sharing leads to better solutions and continuous learning. My approach has added value across both manufacturing and consulting organizations. With proven experience as a Project Manager, I excel at balancing technical detail with delivery focus to ensure optimal outcomes for clients—always with safety as a top priority.
I bring a broad technical foundation gained from diverse industry experience, including piping systems, hygienic design (e.g., cheese taps), and equipment built in black steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. My core competencies include 3D and 2D design using tools such as SolidWorks, Inventor, CATIA V5, and AutoCAD. I adapt quickly to new CAD platforms and am confident in delivering high-quality engineering solutions across disciplines.
