GABRIEL


Summary
======

This 39-year-old candidate brings over 10 years of hands-on experience in CNC milling and turning, with a strong focus on working within extremely tight tolerances. He has extensive experience producing one-off, highly specialized components — some so sensitive that only certified personnel are allowed to handle them post-production.

He has worked abroad, including in Denmark, and speaks English well. A mature and reliable professional, he takes pride in delivering high-quality results and is fully prepared for night shift work. Ideal for roles requiring precision, independence, and trust.
