MICHAEL
Software Developer


Summary
======
Have extensive experience from Warwick University (UK), Birmingham University (UK), University of Aarhus (DK), and from The National Agency for IT and Learning (STIL)¹ (DK). Since I was introduced to Unix and the Unix environment during my studies, Unix has played a major role in my professional career. Within the Unix/Linux context I have extensive experience in: • Various operating systems: RedHat, CentOS, Ubuntu, SUSE, HP-UX, Raspbian • Programming, scripting and automation (C, Perl, PHP, R, bash, CSH) • Software development • Cloud AWS and OpenStack • Databases - MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL • Servers • Hardware Teaching web, mail, NIS, NFS, Nginx, Apache, Samba, DNS PC and Raspberry Pi

In STIL I worked on most operational aspects of the AWS cloud and Linux based business critical system www.netproever.dk — Deploys, scripting (SQL, Perl, Terraform, Ansible), back-end technical support. And developing an automatic status-checking and-reporting system for the www.netproever.dk-system (written in Perl and R).The latest PHP-project was Mac-o-matic — a web-based system for administration of DHCP and DNS services.The largest Splus (and later ported to R) related project was maximum likelihood estimation within the 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional hyperbolic distribution.My results are achieved by working:• Systematically• Analytically• Logically and by knowing where to find answers to hard technical problems.As a person, I am stable, service-minded, responsible and loyal and able to work in great detail, but also able to keep the overview, when hell breaks loose. I am used to work both in teams and on my own. I am able to communicate technical stuff to both technical and non-technical people.
