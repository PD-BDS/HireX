Summary
======
Certified Marine Engineer with a background as an Electrician. For most of the past 10 years, I've worked in boiler service onboard ships, which has given me broad experience in electricity, automation, and mechanics. I'm used to working in multicultural environments and understand the importance of clear communication as one of the key factors in delivering quality results. My strengths lie in automation and troubleshooting, and I have a strong ability to analyze, identify errors, and suggest electrical or mechanical optimizations.
