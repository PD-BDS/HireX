HELGA


Summary
======
With many years of experience in safety, occupational health, and management systems within the marine, manufacturing, and wind industries, I have developed a strong understanding of how to effectively implement and integrate HSE initiatives. I work in a structured and proactive manner to enhance safety levels, minimize risks, and ensure compliance, while fostering a culture were safety and occupational health are a natural part of daily operations. My experience includes working in international environments in Denmark and abroad, where I have contributed to the development and implementation of HSE strategies, risk assessments, and safety procedures across multiple locations. Throughout my career, I have assisted companies in navigating regulatory requirements, optimizing workplace safety initiatives, and creating efficient processes that support a safe and legally compliant operation.
