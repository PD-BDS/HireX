Summary
======
An experienced lead engineer with more than 25 years of experience working as Site, Commissioning, and Process manager.
I have strong communicative and interpersonal skills together with profound experience working across cultures and across professional disciplines. I am a team player with focus on planning, executing, problem solving during pre-planning, erection, and commissioning. I am used to that training and education of the on-site personnel is an integrated part of handing over the project.
