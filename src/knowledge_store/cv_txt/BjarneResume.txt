BJARNE
Supervisor


Summary
======

With over 25 years of extensive experience in the welding and piping industry, I have a proven track record of leading and managing complex projects, particularly within power plant construction and industrial installations, including factories. My expertise covers all aspects of welding and mechanical work, where I serve as a specialist in both execution and supervision.

A key focus of my role is Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE). I prioritize safety above all else and actively implement it through staff meetings, training sessions, and continuous guidance on safe working practices. In addition to project supervision, I take pride in teaching and mentoring operators and teams, ensuring they gain both technical knowledge and a strong safety mindset.

I bring not only deep technical know-how but also the leadership and teaching skills necessary to develop people while delivering projects to the highest standards of quality and safety.
