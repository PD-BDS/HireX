JAN
HSE Supervisor


Summary
======

In my career, I have specialized in developing and implementing HSE strategies that elevate safety standards while supporting operational efficiency. In the cement industry, I designed a replicable O&M framework that integrated Standard Operating Procedures with robust HSE management systems. As Quarry Manager in Angola, I introduced and enforced HSE protocols across quarry and crusher operations, while contributing to site-wide safety initiatives. My work emphasized risk mitigation, workforce protection, and compliance, alongside measurable improvements in raw material quality, fuel efficiency, and emissions reduction.
At Logical Safety, I advanced my expertise in digital HSE systems, LOTO procedures, and sensor-based safety solutions. I also contributed to knowledge transfer by lecturing on operational safety in Cairo and conducting a full HSE Workplace Evaluation for a Danish factory in 2022. I believe in positioning HSE as a driver of responsibility and accountability within the workforce, ensuring safety is not only a compliance obligation but also a source of synergy between production, maintenance, and community engagement.
