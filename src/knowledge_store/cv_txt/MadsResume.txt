 - Developed new product line (Icon series) of USB modules for remote controls of Software plug-ins in DAW's
 - Chosen microcontrollers from Microchip SAM D and ST STM32 processor families for these products
 - Included various UI features, including display on some modules
 - Created 8 different modules: TC2290-DT, DVR250-DT, TC1210-DT, TC8210-DT, Master X HD-DT, Brickwall HD-DT, PEQ3000-DT, and DYN3000-DT
 - Daily coordination with scrum team members and stakeholders (product owners, shared services, and other external dependencies) every 1-3 weeks

Senior Digital Hardware Engineer
Broadcast and Studio Products
2008 - 2015
 - Senior Digital Hardware Engineer for Broadcast and Studio products
 - Scrum introduced for all project teams, and I became team member on the Broadcast and Studio team
 - Implemented digital part of a new processing platform for a new line of Broadcast products for 24/7 transmission
 - Platform was based on NXP i.MX251 ARM9 processor and Analog Devices Sharc DSP's
 - The platform also contained complex high-speed interfaces such as 3G SDI and MADI
 - Many of the interface features was implemented in FPGA for some of the product variants
 - Intensive simulation prior to PCB release of all the high-speed interfaces was made using Mentor Graphics Hyperlynx
 - Mainboard ended up being released in version A and 'Right the first time' principles have been used ever since
 - Product releases based on the new platform: DB6, Upcon, Loudness Pilot, Reverb Twentyfour and Clarity X
 - Most of the products became available in different processing and I/O configurations

Senior Digital Hardware Engineer
Studio Products
2004 - 2008
 - Hardware TFM (Task Force Manager) and Senior Digital Hardware Engineer for Studio products
 - Hardware lead on projects for the Studio marked implementing DSP platforms using the DICE chips and Freescale DSPs
 - Daily coordinating HW tasks with team members for other disciplines such as power supply, analog audio design and PLL design
 - Weekly coordination with project management and TFMs for mechanics, software and production/testing
 - The outcome of these projects was a product line that included Konnekt 8, Konnekt 24D (later released as Impact Twin), Konnekt Live, Studiokonnekt 48, Desktop Konnekt and BMC-2
 - Implemented interface chip (FPGA) for the joint venture with Dynaudio Professional for their AIR Series of Studio Monitors

Lead Engineer
Large Custom Chip Project
2000 - 2004
 - Designed and developed custom chip integrating ARM processor system, complex PLL technology (JetPLL), High bandwidth audio routing engine and all known digital audio formats incl. Audio over Firewire (IEEE1394) for multichannel / multiformat audio interfaces
 - Link to public chip announcement: https://www.mixonline.com/recording/tc-applied-technologies-launches-dice-ii-chip-set-374534
 - Leading/Guiding 5 engineers and coordinated with external design houses (Sonopsis, Synopsys and Samsung) for some of the technology and the backend process (synthesis, technology choice, layout and testing)
 - Chip was not only used for internal use but was sold to other customers and became the choice for many of our competitors designing audio interface products with Firewire
 - The chip team was for several reasons moved to an independent company, TC Applied Technologies in Canada and DICE II was used as background for future chip releases such as DICE Jr, DICE Mini and DICE III
 - I chose not to move with the team to Canada
