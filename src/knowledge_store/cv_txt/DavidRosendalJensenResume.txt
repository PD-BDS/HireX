DAVID ROSENDAL JENSEN


Summary
======
I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering and Informatics from Aalborg University. I am curious, goal-oriented, and analytical, with a strong interest in how technology, data, and intelligent systems can be used to create value and support decision-making across sectors. Through my studies, I have gained solid experience with health data, programming, system development, and the application of digital technologies in complex environments. My specialization includes, among other things, deep learning, machine learning, and algorithm development, and I am passionate about applying these skills to develop data-driven and practical solutions. I am motivated by creating technology that solves real problems and contributes to efficiency, innovation, and improved outcomes.


PROJECTS
======
Master thesis
02/2025 - 06/2025
 - Developed one pan-cancer and two tissue-specific deep learning models for cancer classification based on H&E-stained tissue sample images.
 - The models used a Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple Instance Learning architecture, where whole tissue images were divided into smaller patches and feature extraction was performed using a truncated pre-trained ResNet50 network.
 - The project investigated the pan-cancer model’s ability to generalize to unseen cancer types.

9th Semester Project
09/2024 - 01/2025
 - Developed a multimodal CNN to predict radiation-induced pneumonitis in lung cancer patients
 - The model integrated CT scans from multiple time points, dosimetric data, and demographic information

8th Semester Project
02/2024 - 06/2024
 - Developed a proof-of-concept system for Point-of-Care Testing, consisting of two modules: one for reducing calibration frequency based on pattern recognition in historical data, and one for error detection using a Bayesian network applied to patient measurements

Bachelor Project
02/2023 - 06/2023
 - Developed an information system focused on improved visualization and utilization of indirect calorimetry in intensive care units.
 - The system combined clinical data overview with research functionalities, including the ability to export subpopulations for statistical analysis.
 - The project aimed to make calorimetry data more accessible and provide a foundation for future guidelines based on empirical data.
