Known for my initiative, strong organizational and analytical skills, and ability to work effectively in team environments while meeting tight deadlines. I have hands-on experience with a wide range of designs and materials—from cast iron tooling to complex fabrications. Committed, reliable, and adaptable, I am open to travel and relocation as required.
