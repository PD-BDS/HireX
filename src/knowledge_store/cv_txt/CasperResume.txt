CASPER
Software Engineer


Summary
======
A result-oriented software engineer with solid experience in software development, system architecture and technical consulting. As a consultant, I deliver high quality, strong business understanding and the ability to quickly navigate complex technical domains. My background as a lead developer, consultant and entrepreneur has given me a broad toolbox and a practical approach to problem solving. I focus on creating concrete value through hands-on development, technical sparring and collaboration close to the business. I have experience from both startups, consultancies and industrial companies, and approach each task with a combination of technical depth and commercial overview. My solutions are scalable, well-documented and developed with a focus on stable operations and business impact. I work independently, communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders and create progress in both agile and classic project environments. With me, you get a reliable and solution-oriented software profile that understands how to translate technology into real value for your business. I regularly hold presentations and workshops in Al and Machine Learning for some of Denmark's largest companies and industry organizations
