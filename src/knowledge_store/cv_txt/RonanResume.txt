RONAN
Commissioning / CQV Engineer


Summary
======
A seasoned professional with 10 years of specialized experience in GxP manufacturing, NPI, and technology projects. Expertise spans process, equipment, automation/controls, and site safety qualification, with a proven track record in commissioning and validation across complex project environments. I bring extensive expertise in leading multidisciplinary teams and managing project groups from greenfield sites through to live production, with a strong focus on CQV activities across clean and black utilities projects. My experience includes hands-on biotechnology NPI project management, covering the development and execution of CQV strategies, as well as authoring, reviewing, and executing protocols for commissioning tests, FAT/SAT, DQ, and IOPQ. I have successfully managed testing and commissioning of vendor installation packages, particularly HVAC systems within pharmaceutical and biotechnology facilities. With in-depth knowledge of GAMP 5, ASTM 2500, 21 CFR Part 11, ICH Q9, HPRA, and FDA regulations, I ensure compliance and quality throughout project lifecycles. Additionally, I am skilled in managing CQV documentation via EIDA, collaborating closely with maintenance and safety teams, and hold advanced proficiency in MS Project, Office, Visio, ValGenesis, and Veeva/TrackWise for efficient change control and project tracking.
