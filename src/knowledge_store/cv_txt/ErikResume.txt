Commissioning Manager


Summary
======
Commissioning Manager. Highly accomplished senior electrical commissioning- and project management professional with over 22 years of experience delivering complex end-to-end EPC projects across the energy sector. I have more than 10 years of hands-on commissioning experience managing EPC projects and leading teams of engineers and technicians for commissioning of ultra reliable HV/MV and LV electrical systems with UPS and emergency back up power generation for critical operation substations, fully remote automation and control centers, and utility scale offshore wind installations with substantial server and network infrastructure. Typical CAPEX of installations I have delivered ranges from $750m - 8Bn. I bring transversal experience across multidisciplinary technical areas and I always contribute in project planning and execution with expert judgment. As an experienced commissioning manager HSE comes first and has the highest priority on my EPC projects. During my career I have worked in PMT roles for OEMS and developers. I have also held full project management as well as engineering management scope of work in both larger, and lean project management teams
