DANIEL MANDRUP
Embedded Software Consultant - Embiox ApS


Summary
======
Embedded Software Consultant - Embiox ApS As the founder of Embiox Aps and as a versatile embedded software engineer my passion for innovative embedded system solutions drives my work. With expertise in embedded Linux, mi- crocontroller programming, system design, network protocols, distributed systems, and wire- less communication, I excel in turning complex technical challenges into efficient, robust solu- tions. Proficient in C and Python, I specialize in microcontroller programming, integrating low- level communication protocols, designing custom embedded Linux distributions using the Yocto Project, and developing applications for both real-time operating systems (RTOS) and embed- ded Linux. My diverse experience encompasses both pioneering new software projects and enhancing existing systems with a keen eye for detail and functionality. My experience within the healthcare sector, known for its stringent quality demands, has honed my skills in delivering high-standard solutions. However, my freelance venture now focuses on a broader range of industries, with a particular interest in projects that leverage my skills within embedded Linux, microcontroller programming, production test, and effective build, release, and test procedures

Projects
======
Master's Thesis - Improvement of Cellular Performance by Offloading Mobile Subscribers to Local Connections
2015 - 2016
M.Sc. Master’s Thesis project (9+10th semester project)
 - In collaboration with Telenor, our project focused on designing a global Wi-Fi hotspot network for Telenor’s mobile subscribers. The primary goal was to offload cellular traffic to broadband connections, specifically leveraging xDSL Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) located at Telenor customer sites.
I gained extensive knowledge in network protocols, layers 1-4, router/modem configurations, and ISP core network infrastructure. I focused on Quality of Service (QoS), traffic identification, authentication protocols, and network security. This involved conducting security assessments using network scans and simulated attacks, as well as evaluating QoS with specialized performance tests. Key areas were Wi-Fi and Ethernet technologies, IPbased QoS, VLANs, Firewall management, and a thorough understanding of network infrastructure components like DSLAM, BRAS, and RADIUS servers.

P7 - Performance Evaluation of Methods for Estimating Bandwidth on Cellular Connections
2014
M.Sc. 7th semester proj
 - Our team successfully implemented three cutting-edge, end-to-end bandwidth estimation methods for cellular networks. Our objective was to explore the potential of reducing data consumption during the bandwidth estimation process, without losing significant accuracy. Following implementation, we compared of these methods against the widely recognized bulk transfer capacity test.

P6 - Noise Suppression in Speech by Spectral Subtraction
2014
B.Sc. 6th semester project
 - The goal of this project was to suppress noise from noisy speech in real-time. The project included MATLAB design followed by the implementation of a noise suppression system running on an ADSP-BF533 Digital Signal Processor. Noise suppression was performed in the frequency domain using spectral subtraction. The final system performed well, and it could be both measured and heard that noise suppression was functional.
Topics: Time and frequency domains (and their transformations), FFT, spectral subtraction, audio sampling and analysis, Digital Signal Processors, MATLAB, C, Assembly.
