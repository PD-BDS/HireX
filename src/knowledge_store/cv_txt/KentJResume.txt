Summary
======

I have developed strong leadership and HSE skills through my military service and various managerial roles in both the maritime and construction sectors. My career spans a wide range of projects, from ship construction and QC supervision to large-scale onshore and offshore construction activities, where HSE considerations have always been a top priority. With hands-on site experience, I have built a strong ability to identify risks, implement safety procedures, and lead teams to maintain the highest HSE standards.
In addition, my communication and stakeholder communication skills have been refined through technical project sales within marine engines, giving me valuable insight into aligning technical execution with customer expectations. I am recognized for my flexibility and adaptability, thriving in dynamic environments, and for my proactive approach to solving challenges on-site. My diverse career background has equipped me with a solid combination of leadership, technical expertise, and a safety-first mindset, ensuring projects are delivered efficiently, without compromising HSE excellence.
