JEPPE


Summary
======
Mechanical Supervisor and well experienced travelling fitter with several years of experience in the construction industry and Marine and Industrial cement sector. I have worked on a wide range of projects – from new construction to major renovations, including installation tasks in factories, ships, onshore projects. My qualifications are strong across all areas of metalwork, installation, and welding. I have also been involved in project handovers, and I understand the importance of proper documentation. I am used to working with and preparing quality assurance documents as a natural part of daily tasks, ensuring everything is correctly installed and fully operational. I have a keen eye for detail and the ability to deliver high-quality work under tight deadlines. I thrive in team-oriented environments, but I am also comfortable working independently on assignments.
