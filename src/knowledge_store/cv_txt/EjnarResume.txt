Summary
======
I have through my whole career worked with equipment and technical projects within cement manufacturing and related industries and materials, e.g. calcined clay, mining and minerals. My core competencies are good general understanding of physics, process and energy, execution of technical project, collaboration and human relations. I am diligent and conscientious and do gladly throw in an extra effort, when needed. I am curious and like to get acquainted with new challenges and technical areas. Although I can work independently, it is through collaboration that I find extra motivation and achieve the best results.
