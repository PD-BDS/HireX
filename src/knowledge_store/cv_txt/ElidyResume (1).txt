ELIDY
Project Site Manager


Summary
======
Electrical Engineer with a specialization in Renewable Energy and a Master’s degree in Electric Power Systems from the University of Seville. I bring comprehensive experience in the design of electrical installations and energy evacuation systems, with a strong focus on medium and utility-scale decentralized photovoltaic (PV) projects. My expertise includes the development, application, and management of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) strategies, supported by the design and administration of CMMS documentation—manuals, schedules, and procedures.I have conducted detailed performance analyses on generation, losses, and efficiency in solar power systems, and consistently ensure high-quality outcomes in project execution and supervision. My experience also encompasses grid integration of PV systems in compliance with regulatory frameworks across Latin America and Europe, with a deep understanding of electricity market operations.
