KARSTEN


Summary
======
Independent and experienced supervisor with over 25 years of expertise in the food industry, water treatment, and soap production. Over the years, I have developed extensive knowledge in the construction of new facilities, expansion of existing ones, and active participation in the startup phase. My leadership style is characterized by direct communication combined with a respectful approach to others. I am known for my proactive attitude and ability to find effective solutions to complex problems. My experience also includes inspection of welds. For me, an agreement is binding once both parties have agreed, and I place great importance on honesty and trust in my working relationships. Safety is a top priority and is considered in every situation we encounter on site.
