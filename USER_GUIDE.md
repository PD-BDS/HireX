# HireX – Quick‑Start User Guide

## What is HireX?
HireX is an AI‑powered recruitment assistant chat application that lets you build structured **Job Descriptions**, **Screen Candidates**, and **Discuss Results** directly from a web interface.



## Getting Started

1. **Create a New Chat** – Click the **New Chat** button to start a new conversation.
2. **Enter Job Description** – Send a message to the assistant with your job requirements. It will guide you to build a structured job description. It extracts what you provide and structures it for your review. You can see the updated job description in the **Job Snapshot** inside the **Active Context** tab.
3. **Start Screening** – When you are satisfied with the extracted **Job Snapshot**, ask the assistant to start screening candidates. It will run a search and show you the results in the chat, including matches and reasoning behind the selection.
4. **Discuss Results** – You can ask the assistant to provide more details about candidates or compare them to help you make a decision.
